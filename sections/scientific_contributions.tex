\item[Computational protein design] 
        I developed a computational method to remodel protein backbones in 
        regions lacking regular secondary structure.  As these regions are both 
        disproportionately important for function and especially difficult to 
        model accurately (owing to the lack of the regular backbone contacts), 
        my method represents a significant step towards the ability to 
        rationally design functional proteins.

\item[Synthetic and systems biology]
        I devised a new method for regulating CRISPR/Cas9 that acts on the 
        individual sgRNA molecules rather than the Cas9 protein itself.  For 
        this reason, my method enables applications that require different 
        targets to be regulated in different ways at different times.
