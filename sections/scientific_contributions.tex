\item[Computational protein design] 
I developed a computational method to remodel protein backbones in regions 
lacking regular secondary structure.  As these regions are both 
disproportionately important for function and especially difficult to model 
accurately (owing to the lack of the regular backbone contacts), my method 
represents a significant step towards the ability to rationally design 
functional proteins.

\item[Synthetic and systems biology]
I devised a new method to regulate CRISPR/Cas9 on a target-by-target basis.  
Unlike many other CRISPR/Cas9 methods, mine is tailored for bacterial cells and 
can therefore be applied to problems such as deciphering mechanisms of 
antibiotic resistance, prototyping synthetic circuits, and controlling 
therapeutic bacteria in vivo.
