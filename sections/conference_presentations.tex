\section{Conference Presentations}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \emph{Computational Protein Backbone Remodeling to Rescue Catalysis.} 
    Described my work to remodel the active site loop of KSI using a novel 
        computational pipeline. (Poster, 2018 Spring EBRC Retreat)

\item \emph{Regulating Cas9's guide RNA with small molecules.} Described my work 
 to design small-molecule inducible guide RNAs for the CRISPR/Cas9 system.  
  (Talk, 2016 Synberc Retreat)

\item \emph{Positioning sidechains in Cas9 via backbone remodeling.} Described 
 my work to change the PAM specificity of Cas9, the endonuclease that drives 
  the CRISPR system.  (Poster, RosettaCon 2015)

\item \emph{Thermodynamic ensembles in protein design.} Described my work to 
 incorporate thermodynamic ensembles into protein design.  (Poster, RosettaCon 
  2014)

\item \emph{The new framework for loop modeling.} Described the changes I made 
 to Rosetta's loop modeling framework to reduce code duplication and to make 
  future development easier.  (Talk, 2014 Summer Rosetta Developers' Meeting)

\item \emph{The new architecture for kinematic closure.} Described the changes 
 I made to Rosetta's kinematic closure framework to support detailed balance.  
  (Talk, 2014 Winter Rosetta Developers' Meeting)
