\section{Research Goals}

Protein design can be succinctly defined as the search for sequences that are 
compatible with some desired 3D structure.  Computational design methods 
currently evaluate only the single lowest energy structures predicted for 
each sequence.  While this approach has led to a remarkable number of 
successful designs, the incorrect assumption that proteins adopt a single 
ground state has become limiting.  In reality, proteins occupy an ensemble of 
different conformations in their ground states.  These ground state ensembles 
are intimately involved in processes like allostery, binding, and even 
catalysis.  To incorporate phenomena like these into future designs, protein 
design must be redefined as the search for sequences that are compatible with 
some desired ensemble.
