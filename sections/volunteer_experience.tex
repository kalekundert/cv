\item[Science \& Health Education Partnership (2012)]
        Designed six science lessons for a fourth-grade class at Leonard Flynn

\item[Boys and Girls Club (2011)]

        and Girls Club.  Our goals as tutors were to provide a supportive 
        environment for students to do homework and to foster good study 
        habits.

        Volunteered as an organic chemistry tutor for students at Foothill 
        Community College.  Learned about the importance and difficulty of 
        clearly presenting complex information.
